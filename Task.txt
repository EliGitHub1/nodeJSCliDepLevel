You are tasked with implementing a CLI that will identify all NPM dependencies at a given level. 

Detailed requirements:
The CLI can be implemented either in Node.js or Java. 
The logic that calculates the level dependencies is provided. See further details below.
The CLI should parse a package.json.lock (see official specification) file and print all the dependencies at a specific level in the dependency tree. The dependencies can’t be calculated if the lock file is not available. 
The command-line utility name is “dlevel”
The CLI arguments are:
Folder path that holds the package.json.lock “--path”
Default: the current folder
If the path is unavailable print an informative message
Level of dependencies to print “--level”
Default: print all the root package dependencies.
Possible “--level” values: 
n < 0: error, print informative message
n = 0 print the root package name & version 
n > max depth of dependency tree: print informative message
0 < n =< max depth of dependency tree: print all the dependencies at that level.
Output examples can be found on the next pages
Example package.json.lock is attached

What are you evaluated on:
Submit source code + clear instructions on how to run it
Accuracy of results
Code quality and readability
Smart usage of OS packages
Added CLI look & feel/common functionality (for example using exit codes)- bonus 















Calculating level dependencies logic
Java:
The jar lock-level-parser-1.0.1.jar is attached.
The class DependencyLevelCalculator should be initiated with the full path of the lock file.
The getLevelDependencies() method calculates the entire dependency hierarchy tree and returns a map. The map entry key is an integer and represents the level of the hierarchy and the entry value for each such key is a list of all the dependencies for a given level. 
The method printLevelDependencies() is mostly for debugging purposes. It gets the map returned by the getLevelDependencies() method as an input and prints the dependencies in all levels. 
Example invocation:

Example output of the printLevelDependencies() method

Node.js
The dependency_parser.js file is attached
The function getLevelDependencies() calculates the entire dependency hierarchy tree and returns a map. The map entry key is an integer and represents the level of the hierarchy and the entry value for each such key is a list of all the dependencies for a given level. The input to this function is the full path of the lock file. 
The function printLevelDependencies() is mostly for debugging purposes. It prints the dependencies at all levels. 
Example invocation 

Example output of the printLevelDependencies() function can be seen in sub section f of the Java section. 






Examples based on the provided package.json.lock file:
Command: 
“dlevel --level 0”
Output:
